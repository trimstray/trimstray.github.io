Hi! Welcome to my website.

## About Me

I'm a System and (tiny) Network Administrator. Also Security Enthusiast.

For the most part, I manage environments based on GNU/Linux and BSD systems.

The postings on this domain are my own and don't necessarily represent my employerâ€™s positions, strategies or opinions.

## Projects/publications

You can find the full source code of my project on [GitHub](https://github.com/trimstray).

I decided to start writing articles on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@trimstray) wall. At this moment they are only in Polish.
